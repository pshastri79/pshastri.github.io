Seek your Frequency
What is important for you may not be for another person.

Here I want to take a deep dive into frequency.

What is your frequency?

One is defined by one’s frequency. What are you thinking? Who are your friends, relationships, your quests? usability, value add that you bring to the community? What are you eager to perform? What can you accomplish in a short period?

Here is an acronym that you can remember when you are seeking your frequency

F — Friends — Who are your friends, and acquaintances?

R — relatives, Relationships — Are your relationships satisfied?

E — Energy — How is your energy? is it positive or negative?

Q — Quest — What is your quest? Are you challenged enough in your life?

U — Usability — What can you deliver to your people?

E — Eagerness, — How eager are you to perform something?

N — Notion — What are your predefined ideas?

C — Challenge competency, define clarity — What is the value added to your life? What are you providing to the community by your presence?

Y — Years, Age — How many years of knowledge are you bringing into the community? do you have a mentor/coach who can help you? How much are your savings?

If you answer the questions posed above in “FREQUENCY” you are summing up your life. If you want to change direction in your life, you have to change one or more of the answers to the above question. What are you waiting for? Just change one and experiment with your life.

Experimentation is life!

Think about your “Happily Ever After” (HEA) and follow the course that leads to that destination.

Set your priorities based on your HEA

You cannot blame anyone else for your outcomes, it is all a sum total of your decisions knowingly or unknowingly. Once you realize this, this is maturity. You start achieving more than you can! You are braver, and smarter than you think you are! Responsibility for your actions is the goal.

Let's look at it one by one:

Friends: You are defined by the friends you make and the ones you let go. Friends are a mirror of yourself.
Returns, Risk, Relationships: Your relationships determine the direction of your life. Choose wisely! Be authentic to yourself. What is it that you want for sure? What is it that you can let go?
Energy: How do you feel while performing an activity?
Quest: What is your must-have goal?
Usability: How useful is a particular activity?
Eagerness: Are you motivated to accomplish a task?
Notion: What are your predefined behaviors that you have to unlearn?
Challenge Clarity, competency: Are you competent to write code? Are you competent to act? Are you up for a challenge?
Years: How many years have you tried this task?
Investment in your life bring your returns. Be aware of the risks that you have to take. You have to be willing to sacrifice something to gain something in return. No pains, no gains.

Make this spreadsheet for your life and list the answers to all the questions above and put down the yearly goal. Compare this for every year. And see how far you have come from when you started in the first place.

Maximize your returns and minimize your risks. If you do not know anything find a mentor/coach and listen more.

Listening brings clarity and answers a lot of questions.

Find your frequency and re-define your life.
